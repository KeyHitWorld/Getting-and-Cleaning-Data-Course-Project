# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

(The following content is about the background of the Course Project)

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

#Repo content

1.Source analysis code(run_analysis.R)

2.README.md

3.CodeBook.md

4.Tidy data required

# The steps of the project
1.Get Data and read data into R.

2.library dplyr package.

3.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

4.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

5.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

6.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

7.From the data set in step 4, creates a second,independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

8.Write to "Second_tidy_data.txt"

All steps are finished by using Rstudio (R version 3.3.2) On MacOS Sierra systerm
